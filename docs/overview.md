## 5. Expanded Git & Hosting Subtasks

### T30. Initialize GitHub Repository
- git init in project root
- Create the GitHub repo & add origin remote
- Commit initial scaffold as Initial Commit

- Add an npm script or CI check to enforce updating the changelog on every release

### T33. Configure Free Hosting
- Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel (or Netlify) free tier
- Set build command (npm run build) & output directory (.next)
- Configure any needed environment variables

### T34. Automate Deployment

- Add a deployment status badge to README.md
- Test by making a small commit and verifying the live site updates

## 6. Next Best Task

üèÅ **T30.1**: Run git init in your project folder and commit the scaffold as Initial Commit. This initializes your repo, ensuring every subsequent change is tracked and easily revertible.

Once that's done, push to GitHub and we'll draft the CONTRIBUTING and changelog docs next. Let's keep the momentum going! üöÄ
