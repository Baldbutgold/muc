UI & UX Guidelines

Buttons | Use standard DaisyUI btn components (btn, btn-primary, btn-outline)
Typography | Use DaisyUI's built-in typography, maintain clear hierarchy
Icons | Use DaisyUI icons or Heroicons where appropriate
Cards | Use DaisyUI card components
Color Scheme | Use the "luxury" theme from DaisyUI for all colors (DO NOT create custom colors)
Responsive Behavior | Mobile-first design, collapsing grids into stacked lists on smaller screens

Theme Configuration
- Use DaisyUI's "luxury" theme for all components
- Do not override or create custom colors
- Leverage DaisyUI's component library for all UI elements instead of creating custom components

GitHub & Changelog Workflow
- Initial Commit: Scaffold Next.js + TailwindCSS + DaisyUI project.
- Each Change: One logical feature per commit (e.g., Add hero section, Write pain section copy).
- Changelog: Update CHANGELOG.md after each feature/section is completed.

Hosting Deployment
- Preferred: Vercel (free tier)
- Automatic Deployment: From main branch
- Test Before Launch: Mobile, tablet, desktop breakpoints; SEO basics (title, meta tags)

Notes
- Maintain a "light, confident, and expert" tone across visuals and copy.
- Prioritize clarity over complexity.
- Launch a Minimum Lovable Version first, then optimize post-launch.
- Always use DaisyUI components instead of building custom ones.
